# CSSO Website

This is a website for a non-profit that we are planning to register with Hackclub HCB later in the year!
It was made by me, Silas Lovett, but the non-profit involves multiple other people.
I hope the website is alright! It's not perfect, but I'm pretty proud of it so far! :D

## Scrapbook Milestones

<ul>
  <li>  Milestone 1: Homepage Mostly Complete<br><br>
    <details>
    <ul>
      <li>25 Hours</li> 
      <li>I hope this is okay, it's my first scrapbook post! Please tell me if I did anything wrong.</li>
      <li>In these hours, I started developing the home page of the website. While it still needs a little bit of work, I am very happy with it so far!</li>
      <li>Going forward, I need to add more javascript to the site, give it a bit more life, customize the 3D spline background, and maybe add some more sections.</li>
      <li>I hope you enjoy the site! It is currently hosted on lerstudios.com/CSSO! Case sensitive! And remember this isn't done yet!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much! :D</li>

  <li>  Milestone 2: Homepage Windows and Page Functionality<br><br>
    <details>
    <ul>
      <li>25 Hours</li> 
      <li>This is a lot more boring than the first post, but its pretty much done! :D</li>
      <li>In these hours, I created many systems that all pages of the website will need to use. Now, I can start making additional pages, with a lot more speed!</li>
      <li>Going forward, I can put my finishing touches on the home page, create a 404 page, develop the site further, and then revisit the home page to add more sections!</li>
